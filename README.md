# Janus DeFi Simulations

Welcome to the Janus DeFi Simulations repository. This project contains simulation code that demonstrates the superior stability and efficiency of the Janus protocol in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

## Overview

Janus DeFi is an AI-powered, inflation-resistant stability protocol that addresses the stablecoin trilemma by providing a decentralized, resilient, and value-preserving store of wealth. By leveraging a dual-token system and advanced AI algorithms, Janus ensures smooth value appreciation and robust stability, even amidst market fluctuations. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Features

- **AI-Powered Stability**: Utilizes advanced AI to dynamically optimize liquidity, stability, and efficiency, adapting to market conditions in real-time. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Dual-Token Ecosystem**: Employs two tokens—Alpha and Omega—to balance supply and demand, reducing volatility and ensuring stable growth. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

- **Inflation Adjustment**: Adjusts to inflationary pressures, preserving purchasing power and providing a resilient store of value. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **Non-Custodial**: Users maintain 100% control of their assets, ensuring security and autonomy. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Simulation Objectives

The simulations in this repository aim to:

1. **Validate Stability Mechanisms**: Demonstrate how Janus maintains stability through its AI-driven dual-token system.

2. **Assess Market Resilience**: Evaluate the protocol's performance under various market conditions, including high volatility scenarios.

3. **Compare with Legacy Stablecoins**: Highlight the advantages of Janus over traditional stablecoins in terms of efficiency, resilience, and inflation resistance.
